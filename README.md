# rag-backlinks-project
This project is a hands-on demonstration of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built around a real PDF document about building better backlinks. It shows how to extract text, create semantic embeddings, store and search them efficiently, and generate precise answers to user questions based on document content.
