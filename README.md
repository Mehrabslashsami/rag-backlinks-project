# RAG Backlinks Project

## Description  
This project is a hands-on demonstration of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built around a real PDF document about building better backlinks. It shows how to extract text, create semantic embeddings, store and search them efficiently, and generate precise answers to user questions based on document content.

The goal is to build a reliable, grounded question-answering tool that uses vector search and language models to avoid making up answers.

## Features  
- Extracts and chunks text from PDF documents  
- Creates semantic embeddings for efficient retrieval  
- Stores embeddings in a FAISS vector database  
- Retrieves relevant chunks based on user questions  
- Uses a language model (Flan-T5) to generate answers based strictly on retrieved content  
- Interactive Q&A for backlink strategies and SEO advice  

---

## How to Use  
1. Open the notebook and upload your PDF (or use the included backlink guide).  
2. Run all the cells in order to prepare the vector store and model.  
3. Enter your questions in the input box and run the answer cell.  
4. The system retrieves relevant document parts and generates grounded answers.

## Sample Questions  
Try asking these to see how it works:  
- What does the document say about using Fiverr for backlinks?  
- How can I find good backlink providers?  
- What common mistakes should I avoid when outsourcing backlinks?  
- How should I organize a backlink building project?  
- What does the guide say about pinging and RSS feeds?

## Why This Project Matters  
Building reliable RAG systems is a key skill in AI engineering. This project proves your ability to combine document processing, vector search, and LLMs to create real-world solutions that avoid hallucinations and give fact-based answers.

## Next Steps  
- Expand with more documents and datasets  
- Build a user-friendly web interface  
- Experiment with larger or custom-trained LLMs for better responses  
- Add logging and evaluation metrics for ongoing improvements
